A Morse code blinker for the Arduino, capable of blinking arbitrary strings.  It makes extensive use of bitwise operations for increased speed, and encodes each character's Morse code representation in a single byte per character.  Written as a side project during my first computer architecture course at UCSB, CS 64.
